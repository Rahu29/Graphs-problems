1) First create a Vertex class for creating a basic structure of Maze using int[][].
2) create a method isFeasibleMove() which will take two parameter row and col and return boolean result.
3) write four conditions in this method -
    1) Values of row and column are not less than 0.
    2) Values of row and col are not greater than int[][] array.
    3) The current position is not visited previously.
    4) The current position must not a wall or any obstacle
    5) If every thing is okay return true at last;
4) Create top method called isWayExist() which will take two parameter row and col and return boolean result.
5) Check 'if' row and col both are the last position i.e. int[][].length - 1, means the last element, if so, then return true.
6) Check 'if' condition for current position isFeasibleMove or not, if it is true then,
    1) Set current position true.
    2) Recursively call same function(isWayExist()) in 'if' condition and increase value of row to go DOWN and return true.
    3) Recursively call same function(isWayExist()) in 'if' condition and decrease value of row to go UP and return true.
    4) Recursively call same function(isWayExist()) in 'if' condition and decrease value of col to LEFT and return true.
    5) Recursively call same function(isWayExist()) in 'if' condition and increase value of col to RIGHT and return true.
    6) At last set current position to be false (If in case there is no way then we need to backtrack thats why we are setting this to false).
7) If all if conditions are failed mentioned in step 6 the return false in that case.
8) END
